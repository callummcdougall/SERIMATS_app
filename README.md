This is my application for Neel Nanda's SERI MATS stream, 2023.

[This colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13exGNqUWQFmXksfGnChraDTW5zUKM3jr) forms the main part of my application.

I'd also like to submit [this Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yV6czsp9EWWGORRIeGrdQDdJJ8b7EI4n) for consideration, which I made as a tutorial for IOI. Most of it is derived from Neel's colab, except for the 4th section (in which I wrote a demo and explanation of path patching, an implementation in TransformerLens, and replicated the results from the original IOI paper).
